### 5 x 5 Tic Tac Toe against a computer

This was my *A.I.* project for the **Artificial Intelligence** exam I had to take last year.

It has easy to hard settings and the interface is made using *html* and *css* while the algorithm runs in *js* with *jquery*.

It uses a minimax function adapted from "[The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/)"'s version of tic tac toe.\
You can work out the details by looking at the code.

The demo runs at https://cristian-a.github.io/Pentrix/
